        <h2>Understanding Civil Law in India</h2>
        <p>
          Civil law deals with non-criminal disputes and includes various legal
          areas such as property disputes, contract issues, family law, and
          torts. The Indian legal system, based on common law principles,
          governs these matters through statutes, regulations, and judicial
          precedents. Key legislations and codes relevant to civil law in India
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Indian Contract Act, 1872:</strong> Governs contracts and
            agreements, including aspects related to the formation, performance,
            and enforcement of contracts.
          </li>

            <strong>Transfer of Property Act, 1882:</strong> Regulates the
            transfer of property and deals with issues related to property
            transactions, ownership, and rights.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Family Law Acts:</strong> Includes various statutes such as
            the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the Special Marriage Act, 1954, and
            the Divorce Act, 1869, which govern family-related matters,
            including marriage, divorce, and child custody.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Civil Procedure Code (CPC), 1908:</strong> Outlines the
            procedures for civil litigation, including the filing of suits,
            evidence presentation, and appeal processes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consumer Protection Act, 2019:</strong> Provides protection
            to consumers against unfair trade practices, defective goods, and
            deficient services.
