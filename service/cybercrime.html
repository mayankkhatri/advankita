        <h2>Understanding Cyber Crime in India</h2>
        <p>
          Cyber crime encompasses a wide range of illegal activities conducted
          through digital means, including the internet, computer systems, and
          mobile devices. In India, cyber crimes are addressed under various
          laws and regulations, and the legal framework is evolving to keep pace
          with technological advancements. Key legislations and regulations
          related to cyber crime in India include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act):</strong> This is
            the primary legislation governing cyber crime in India. It defines
            various offenses and penalties related to cyber activities,
            including hacking, identity theft, data theft, and cyber fraud.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860:</strong> Certain sections of
            the IPC also apply to cyber crimes, such as those related to
            criminal breach of trust, forgery, and defamation when committed
            through digital means.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >The IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code)
              Rules, 2021:</strong
            >
            These rules provide guidelines for intermediaries and digital media
            platforms, ensuring compliance with legal standards and addressing
            grievances related to content and cyber crimes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Cyber Crime Investigation and Prosecution Guidelines:</strong
            >
            Issued by law enforcement agencies, these guidelines help in the
            investigation and prosecution of cyber crime cases, providing a
            structured approach for handling such cases.
