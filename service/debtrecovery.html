              The **Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT)** is a specialized legal forum
              in India that adjudicates matters related to the recovery of debts
              due to banks and financial institutions. Established under the
              **Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act,
              1993 (RDDBFI Act)**, the DRT is empowered to handle cases
              involving a large amount of debt, typically over ₹20 lakhs.
            </p>

            <p>
              Advocate Ankita Goswami and her team provide comprehensive legal
              services in matters involving the DRT, representing both creditors
              (banks and financial institutions) and debtors. Understanding the
              complexities involved in these cases, she offers strategic advice
              and practical solutions to expedite the recovery process while
              adhering to the legal framework.
            </p>

            <h3>What is the Debt Recovery Tribunal?</h3>
            <p>
              The DRT was created to fast-track the process of debt recovery,
              which was previously slow and inefficient through traditional
              civil courts. The tribunal has the authority to hear and decide
              applications filed by banks or financial institutions to recover
              outstanding debts. It can also issue orders to attach properties,
              conduct inquiries, and determine liability quickly and
              efficiently.
            </p>

            <p>
              Unlike traditional courts, the DRT has specialized expertise in
              debt recovery matters, making it an ideal forum for resolving
              these cases effectively. It also offers an appeal mechanism
              through the **Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT)** for
              parties seeking further redress.
            </p>

            <h3>How Advocate Ankita Goswami Can Help You</h3>
            <p>

              amounts of money or a debtor seeking legal protection, Advocate
              Ankita can assist you throughout the entire DRT process. With a

              matters, she ensures that your case is handled diligently and
              effectively.
            </p>

            <h3>The Importance of Legal Representation in DRT Cases</h3>
            <p>
              Navigating the DRT can be complex due to its specialized nature.
              Without a seasoned legal professional, individuals and

              Her in-depth knowledge of relevant laws, including the **RDDBFI
              Act**, the **Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets
              and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (SARFAESI)**, and the
              **Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)**, allows her to tailor her
              legal strategies to the specific needs of each case.
            </p>
