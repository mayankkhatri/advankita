          <h2>Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)</h2>
          <div class="service-text">
            <p>
              <strong>Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)</strong> refer to the
              legal protections granted to creators and inventors for their
              intellectual creations. These rights allow individuals and
              businesses to control the use of their creative works, inventions,
              brands, and other intellectual property. In India, IPR laws are
              governed by various acts, and these rights play a crucial role in
              promoting innovation, creativity, and economic growth. The main
              types of intellectual property rights in India include patents,
              trademarks, copyrights, designs, and geographical indications.
            </p>

            <h3>Types of Intellectual Property Rights in India</h3>
            <p>
              Intellectual property is an umbrella term that covers a wide range
              of rights. In India, these rights are protected by several key
              legislations:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Patents:</strong> Patents protect inventions that are
                new, involve an inventive step, and are capable of industrial
                application. The Indian Patents Act, 1970 governs the grant of
                patents in India. Once granted, a patent provides the inventor
                exclusive rights to manufacture, sell, and license the invention
                for a period of 20 years.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Trademarks:</strong> A trademark is a distinctive sign,
                logo, or symbol used by businesses to differentiate their goods
                or services from others. The Trademarks Act, 1999 governs the
                registration, protection, and enforcement of trademarks in
                India. Trademarks can be renewed indefinitely, as long as they
                are in use and renewed every 10 years.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Copyrights:</strong> Copyright law in India protects the
                creators of original literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic
                works, as well as cinematographic films and sound recordings.
                The Copyright Act, 1957 grants authors exclusive rights to
                reproduce, distribute, and communicate their works to the public
                for a specific period, typically the lifetime of the author plus
                60 years.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Designs:</strong> Design rights protect the aesthetic
                aspects of products, such as the shape, pattern, or
                ornamentation. The Designs Act, 2000 provides for the
                registration and protection of industrial designs in India for a
                period of 10 years, extendable by another five years.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Geographical Indications (GI):</strong> GI rights
                protect products that originate from a specific geographical
                region and have qualities, reputation, or characteristics linked
                to that location. Examples include Darjeeling Tea, Mysore Silk,
                and Basmati Rice. The Geographical Indications of Goods
                (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999 governs GIs in India.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              These intellectual property rights are crucial for businesses and
              creators, as they provide legal protection and enable them to
              monetize their creations. Violations of IPR can result in
              financial losses and damage to reputation, which is why it is
              essential to have a robust legal strategy in place to protect
              these assets.
            </p>
