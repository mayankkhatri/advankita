          <h2>Public Interest Litigation (PIL)</h2>
          <div class="service-text">
            <p>
              <strong>Public Interest Litigation (PIL)</strong> is a unique
              legal mechanism in India that empowers individuals or groups to
              seek judicial intervention in matters of public interest. The
              concept of PIL is rooted in the idea that the judiciary should
              play an active role in protecting the rights of the marginalized
              and ensuring social justice. It allows citizens to approach the
              courts to address grievances that affect the public at large, even
              if they are not directly involved in the issue at hand.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Supreme Court of India and various High Courts have developed
              the jurisprudence surrounding PILs to address issues such as
              environmental protection, human rights violations, public health
              concerns, and social justice. PILs are particularly significant in
              a country like India, where a significant portion of the
              population may lack access to legal resources and avenues to seek
              justice. The judiciary's willingness to entertain PILs reflects
              its commitment to safeguarding the rights of citizens and
              promoting accountability among public authorities.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Features of Public Interest Litigation in India</h3>

            <p>
              PILs have distinct characteristics that differentiate them from
              traditional litigation. Here are some essential features of Public
              Interest Litigation in India:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Accessibility:</strong> PILs can be filed by any
                individual or organization, including those who are not directly
                affected by the issue. This makes it easier for citizens to
                raise concerns about matters that impact the larger community.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Wider Standing:</strong> The courts have liberalized the
                standing requirement in PIL cases, allowing individuals or
                groups acting in good faith to bring cases on behalf of others.
                This ensures that the voices of the marginalized and vulnerable
                are heard.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Social Justice Focus:</strong> PILs are often filed to
                address issues related to social justice, environmental
                degradation, and human rights violations. The courts have played
                a proactive role in addressing these issues through PILs,
                contributing to the broader goal of achieving justice for all.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Judicial Activism:</strong> PILs reflect a trend of
                judicial activism, where the judiciary takes an active role in
                shaping public policy and holding public authorities accountable
                for their actions. The courts have expanded the scope of
                constitutional rights through PILs, emphasizing the need for
                social and economic justice.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Remedies and Directions:</strong> The courts have the
                power to issue a wide range of remedies in PIL cases, including
                orders for policy changes, directions to public authorities, and
                interim relief measures. This enables the courts to address
                systemic issues and promote compliance with the law.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Public Participation:</strong> PILs encourage public
                participation in governance and legal processes. They empower
                citizens to engage with legal institutions and advocate for
                their rights, fostering a culture of accountability and
                transparency.
              </li>
            </ul>
